According to a 2016 study, the average yearly no-show rate for primary care and specialty medical appointments is just under 20 percent !
This is a large number and can lead to a loss of large amounts of time and money in the Healthcare industry !
In this project we will be performing an Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset containing appointment details of various patients and 
try to analyze why some patients do not show up for their medical appointment .
We will try to find some correlation between the different attributes of the patints and their missed appointment ! 
The dataset we are going to use contains 110.527 medical appointments and its 14 associated variables ( PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap', SMS_received, No-show )
